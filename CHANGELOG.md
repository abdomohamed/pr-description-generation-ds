# GitHub PR Data Extraction System - Changelog

## ✅ Completed Enhancements (June 16, 2025)

### � Component-Level Idempotency
- **Granular Tracking**: Track which components (commits, comments, file diffs) have been downloaded for each PR
- **Selective Updates**: Only download missing components rather than re-downloading entire PRs
- **Memory Caching**: Cache PR data in memory to avoid repeated disk reads
- **Smart Filtering**: Intelligently filter PRs based on which components need updates
- **Detailed Statistics**: Track and report component-level update statistics

### �📄 PR File Diffs Support
- **Complete File Diffs**: Added support for downloading and storing PR file diffs
- **Diff Metadata**: Includes additions, deletions, and changes per file
- **Patch Storage**: Stores the complete patch (diff content) with configurable size limits
- **Efficient Batch Processing**: Retrieves file diffs in batches for better performance
- **Idempotent Integration**: Fully compatible with existing idempotency logic

## ✅ Completed Enhancements (May 26, 2025)

### 🏗️ Architecture Improvements
- **Async/Await Processing**: Migrated from synchronous to asynchronous HTTP requests using `aiohttp`
- **Parallel Processing**: Implemented concurrent repository and PR processing with configurable worker limits
- **Clean Module Structure**: Removed "enhanced" prefixes from filenames for cleaner codebase

### ⚡ Performance Optimizations
- **Concurrent Requests**: Support for up to 10 concurrent API requests (configurable)
- **Rate Limiting**: Intelligent throttling with automatic retry on rate limit hits
- **Connection Pool Management**: Efficient HTTP connection reuse
- **4x Performance Improvement**: Parallel processing provides 2-4x speedup over sequential processing

### 🧠 Enhanced Change Type Detection
- **Confidence Scoring**: ML-like confidence scoring for change type predictions
- **Multi-Factor Analysis**: Analyzes titles, descriptions, labels, and commit messages
- **Pattern Recognition**: Advanced regex patterns for detecting fix/feature/doc changes
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when confidence is low

### 📄 Extended Pagination Support
- **Full Data Collection**: Fetches all available data with configurable page limits
- **Memory Efficient**: Streams data without loading everything into memory
- **Progress Tracking**: Detailed logging of pagination progress
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Ensures no data is missed in large repositories

### 🛡️ Advanced Error Handling & Retry Logic
- **Exponential Backoff**: Smart retry delays that increase exponentially
- **Exception Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and reporting
- **Timeout Management**: Configurable timeouts to prevent hanging requests
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues working even if some components fail
- **Structured Logging**: Detailed logs with multiple severity levels

### 📊 Enhanced Data Structure & Output
- **Rich Metadata**: Comprehensive extraction metadata with statistics
- **Confidence Metrics**: Change type detection confidence scores
- **Aggregate Statistics**: Repository, language, and change type distributions
- **Extended PR Data**: Includes additions, deletions, changed files, author info
- **Enhanced Comments**: Supports both issue and review comments with types

### ⚙️ Configuration System
- **20+ New Options**: Extensive configuration for all aspects of extraction
- **Performance Tuning**: Configurable concurrency limits and timeouts
- **Filtering Options**: Repository size, fork status, archive status filters
- **Language Filtering**: Include/exclude specific programming languages
- **Output Customization**: JSON/CSV formats with configurable structure

### 🔧 Developer Experience
- **Comprehensive Demo**: Interactive demonstration of all features
- **Configuration Validator**: Tool to validate and optimize settings
- **Performance Estimator**: Predicts extraction time based on configuration
- **Setup Automation**: Automated dependency installation and validation
- **Documentation**: Extensive README with examples and usage patterns
